## Project Overview

**Lease Ease** is a platform designed to enhance communication between tenants and landlords, making property management more efficient and transparent. By streamlining communication, handling maintenance requests, and tracking rent payments, Lease Ease simplifies the management process for both parties.

Effective communication between tenants and landlords is vital to resolving maintenance issues, handling rent payments, and keeping both sides informed. Without a centralized system, managing these aspects can be overwhelming. Lease Ease aims to centralize these tasks in a user-friendly platform, ensuring quick, clear, and transparent interactions between tenants and landlords.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a **frontend-focused landlord-tenants communication platform** that allows tenants to:
- Report maintenance issues
- Track maintenance requests
- Communicate seamlessly with landlords
- Stay updated on rent payments

The platform will feature an intuitive, user-friendly interface to help tenants and landlords manage their communication efficiently.

## Features

### Multi-Tenant Authentication and Role-Based Data Access

The platform incorporates a robust **multi-tenant authentication and role-based data access system** to ensure secure and efficient property management. Each tenant is granted access only to their own data, enabling personalized interaction and maintaining strict privacy. In contrast, the landlord, as the sole administrator, has comprehensive access to all tenant data for properties under their management. This architecture ensures scalability by supporting multiple tenants while preserving data isolation. By implementing this system, the platform delivers a secure, transparent, and user-friendly experience tailored to the landlord's oversight needs and the tenants' individual interactions.

### Intuitive Maintenance Request System

- **Interactive Submission Form:** Tenants can report maintenance issues with step-by-step guidance. They can categorize issues, select urgency levels, and upload images or videos for better clarity.
- **Auto-Suggestions for Common Issues:** Common issues are auto-suggested as tenants type, making the reporting process faster and more accurate.
- **Real-Time Validation and Feedback:** Ensures that all information is correctly entered before submission, improving the quality of reported issues.

### Issue Tracking Dashboard

- **Tenant View:** Tenants can track the status of submitted requests (e.g., pending, in progress, completed) using visual indicators like badges and progress bars.
- **Landlord View:** The landlord can filter and manage reported issues based on property, type, urgency, or status. The landlord can also update issue statuses to keep tenants informed.
- **Timeline of Actions:** A timeline for each request gives both tenants and landlords a clear overview of the process, from submission to resolution.
- **Push Notifications and Alerts:** Notifications for new messages or changes in request status, ensuring both tenants and landlords stay updated.

### Maintenance History and Reports

- **Maintenance Record for Properties:** The landlord can track the history of all maintenance requests per property, helping them prioritize repairs and monitor recurring issues.
- **Exportable Reports:** The landlord can export maintenance history in CSV or PDF formats for easy record-keeping and sharing with property management companies.

### Rent Payment Tracker

- **Payment History:** Tenants can view past rent payments, due dates, and amounts, while the landlord can track payment status across properties.
- **Interactive Rent Reminders:** Tenants receive reminders to mark payments as "completed" or request a delay. The landlord is instantly notified of payment statuses.
- **Payment Status Dashboard for Landlord:** The landlord can monitor overdue payments and send reminders with a single click.

### Responsive Design and Mobile Optimization

- **Mobile-First Approach:** The platform is optimized for mobile use, ensuring that tenants and landlords can access it on smartphones with touch-friendly interactions.
- **Adaptive UI:** The interface adapts to larger screens (e.g., tablets and desktops), providing an enhanced experience with more visible details.

### User Profiles and Customization

- **Personalized Tenant Profiles:** Tenants can customize their profiles with avatars, contact information, and preferred communication methods (e.g., email or SMS).
- **Landlord Management Console:** The landlord can manage multiple properties through a single dashboard and configure individual property settings.

### Interactive Maintenance Scheduling

- **Appointment Booking System:** Tenants can schedule appointments for repairs, selecting preferred time slots. The landlord can approve or reschedule appointments as needed.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Tenants receive updates on technician arrival times and progress throughout the maintenance process.

## Key Goals

- **Seamless Communication:** Facilitate real-time, clear communication for quicker issue resolution.
- **Efficient Maintenance Tracking:** Simplify the management of maintenance requests and provide clear visibility for all parties.
- **Transparent Rent Payment System:** Ensure both tenants and landlords are well-informed about payment statuses and deadlines.
- **Mobile-Optimized Interface:** Ensure a user-friendly, responsive design for an optimal experience on all devices.
